# Task Estimation in SCRUM
## Introduction
Task estimation is the process of assigning a numerical value to the effort or complexity of a task or a user story in a software project. Task estimation is a crucial aspect of Scrum, helping teams plan and manage their work effectively. In our fast-moving startup, we recognize the need for a standardized approach to task estimation to improve project predictability and reduce defects in production. This handbook outlines the best practices for task estimation within our Scrum framework.

**Task estimation will help the team to:**
- Plan and prioritize their work based on the value and the effort of each user story.
- Track and measure their progress and performance using metrics such as velocity and burndown charts.
- Communicate and align their expectations and assumptions with the Product Owner and other stakeholders.
- Identify and resolve any issues or risks that may affect the quality or the delivery of the product.
- Improve and learn from their experience and feedback.

**Some key terms and concepts related to task estimation in Scrum are:**
- **User stories**: A user story is a short and simple description of a feature or a requirement from the perspective of the end user. 
- **Tasks**: A task is a specific and actionable unit of work that is required to complete a user story.User story can be broken down into multiple tasks, depending on size and complexity.
- **Story points**: A story point is a unit of measurement that represents the relative effort or complexity of a user story. Story points are not equivalent to hours or days, but rather to a level of difficulty or uncertainty. For example, simple and well defined user story may have 1 story point, while complex and vague uers story may have 8 story points.
- **Velocity**: Velocity is the average number of story points that a Scrum team can complete in a sprint. Velocity is calculated by dividing the total number of story points completed in the last few sprints by the number of sprints. This will help the team to estimate how much work they can commit to in the next sprint, and to forecast how long it will take to deliver the product backlog.
- **Sprint**: A sprint is a fixed period, in which the team works on a set of user stories that they have committed to deliver. A sprint consists of four main events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.
