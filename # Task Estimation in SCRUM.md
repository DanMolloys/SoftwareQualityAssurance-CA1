# Task Estimation in SCRUM

## What is Task Estimation?
Task estimation is the process of assigning a numerical value to the effort or complexity of a task or a user story in a software project. Task estimation is a crucial aspect of Scrum, helping teams plan and manage their work effectively. In our fast-moving startup, we recognize the need for a standardized approach to task estimation to improve project predictability and reduce defects in production. This handbook outlines the best practices for task estimation within our Scrum framework.

**Task estimation will help the team to:**
- Plan and prioritize their work based on the value and the effort of each user story.
- Track and measure their progress and performance using metrics such as velocity and burndown charts.
- Communicate and align their expectations and assumptions with the Product Owner and other stakeholders.
- Identify and resolve any issues or risks that may affect the quality or the delivery of the product.
- Improve and learn from their experience and feedback.

**Some key terms and concepts related to task estimation in Scrum are:**
- **User stories**: A user story is a short and simple description of a feature or a requirement from the perspective of the end user. 
- **Tasks**: A task is a specific and actionable unit of work that is required to complete a user story.User story can be broken down into multiple tasks, depending on size and complexity.
- **Story points**: A story point is a unit of measurement that represents the relative effort or complexity of a user story. Story points are not equivalent to hours or days, but rather to a level of difficulty or uncertainty. For example, simple and well defined user story may have 1 story point, while complex and vague uers story may have 8 story points.
- **Velocity**: Velocity is the average number of story points that a Scrum team can complete in a sprint. Velocity is calculated by dividing the total number of story points completed in the last few sprints by the number of sprints. This will help the team to estimate how much work they can commit to in the next sprint, and to forecast how long it will take to deliver the product backlog.
- **Sprint**: A sprint is a fixed period, in which the team works on a set of user stories that they have committed to deliver. A sprint consists of four main events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.

## Task Estimation Techniques

**Planning Poker**

Planning Poker is a consensus-based technique. The team can a set of cards with numbers that represent story points, such as the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.). After a user story is briefly discused, each team member secretly selects a card that represents their estimate for the user story. The cards are revealed simultaneously, and the team compares their estimates. Incase of large discrepancy, further discussion about the reasons and the assumptions behind their estimates is done and the initial process is repeated to reach a consensus.

- Advantages:
    - <b>Promotes inclusivity</b>, ensures that everyone gets a chance to contribute to the estimation process. It encourages private estimates to prevent bias and promotes discussion
    - <b>Effective management of unknowns</b>, allows for continuous negotiation and adjustment of estimates throughout a session. It emphasizes estimating uncertain items first, reducing the risk of scope creep.
    - <b>Efficiency and flexibility</b>, when used with story points, helps in tracking velocity and estimating future work, reducing overcommitment of resources. 

- Disadvantages:
    - <b>Disagreements or Misunderstandings</b>, if team members are not fully aware of how the process works. These misunderstandings can potentially disrupt the team dynamics and result in work not being done in the most beneficial way.
    - <b>May not be suitable for complex tasks</b>, planning poker is more suited to short-term weekly sprints, complex tasks need to be broken down into smaller, manageable parts, which can be challenging and time-consuming.
    - <b>Can be time-consuming to plan</b>, planning a short sprint using the poker methodology can take longer then it is worth. It also may not account for work done outside of typical working hours, making it a less flexible option compared to other planning methodologies.

**T-shirt sizing**

T-shirt sizing is a relative technique that involves the team using a set of categories that represent the size of a user story, such as XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL, etc. After a user story is briefly discused, each team member votes for a category that represents their estimate for the user story. The team compares their votes and decides on a final category for the user story.

- Advantages:
    - <b>Simplified estimation</b>, enables teams to quickly estimate time to be taken on a large number of items.
    - <b>Good gauge for the team</b>, as this is a rough estimate it gives the team an outline of how extensive the project will be and how deep they should go
    - <b>Easily readjusted</b>, as the sizes are loose, if one piece becomes delayed it is easy to simply bump it up a size and plan accordingly.

- Disadvantages:
    - <b>Consistent relative sizes.</b>, Everyone must be in agreemet of what the sizes mean. If someone thinks a small is 10 minutes but its actually 2 days, this will lead to massive faults.
    - <b>Less accurate</b>, as this is a rough estimate, it will definatily be less accurate then a using numeric values.

- **Dot Voting**

Dot Voting is a democratic technique that involves team using a set of markers that represent votes. After a user story is briefly discused, the team places the user story on a board, along with other user stories that have been estimated. Each team member has a limited number of votes that they can distribute among the user stories, according to their estimates. Ater the votes are counted, numerical values are assigned to user story based on the number of votes.

- Advantages:
    - <b>Fairness</b>, As everyone in the team is given one vote,and the overall decision goes with the majority vote, it is a very fair way of creating a plan.
    - <b>Team Engagement</b>, As everyone is required to vote, it will ensure everyone's voice is heard and opinion stated.
    - <b>Quick</b>, As the options are set out plainly, all team members do i put a dot on the option they want, leading to fast and efficent decisions and meetings.
- Disadvantages:
    - <b>Option shortage</b>, As there is a only a set amount to vote on, if what you think is best isn't even an option, you may have to suggest a new method.
    - <b>Cause and Effect</b>, Sometimes one task must be completed beofre another can begin and the dot method doesn't really allow for explaination on this and how one decision can effect another.

### Some tips and best practices for choosing and applying the appropriate technique for different situations are:

1. Consider the size and the complexity of the user stories, and choose a technique that can handle them effectively and efficiently. For example, Planning Poker may be more suitable for small or medium user stories, while T-shirt sizing or Dot Voting may be more suitable for large or complex user stories.
2. Consider the time and the resources available for the task estimation process, and choose a technique that can fit them realistically and optimally. For example, Planning Poker may require more time and effort, while T-shirt sizing or Dot Voting may require less time and effort.
3. Consider the preferences and the expectations of the team and the Product Owner, and choose a technique that can satisfy them adequately and satisfactorily. For example, Planning Poker may provide more accuracy and reliability, while T-shirt sizing or Dot Voting may provide more simplicity and flexibility.
4. Experiment and compare different techniques and choose a technique that can deliver the best results and outcomes. For example, the team can try different techniques for different user.
