## What are Code Reviews?

Code reviews involve examining and evaluating code written by peers to ensure its quality, efficiency, and adherence to established standards. They provide an opportunity for collaboration, knowledge sharing, and early identification of issues in the development process.

## Benefits of Code Reviews


## Best Practices for Code Reviews
1. **Establish Clear Guidelines:** Define clear guidelines and standards for code reviews, including coding conventions, design patterns, and documentation requirements.

2. **Conduct Regular Reviews:** Schedule regular code review sessions as part of the development process to ensure prompt and comprehensive review of code changes.

3. **Involve Multiple Reviewers:** Encourage participation from multiple reviewers with varying levels of experience to gain diverse perspectives and insights.

4. **Provide Constructive Feedback:** Offer actionable feedback and suggestions for improvement, focusing on specific issues and areas for enhancement.

5. **Use Automated Tools:** Leverage automated code analysis tools to augment manual reviews and identify common issues such as coding errors and security vulnerabilities.

6. **Prioritize High-Impact Changes:** Prioritize code reviews for high-impact changes, such as new features or critical bug fixes, to ensure thorough review and validation.

7. **Document Review Decisions:** Maintain a record of review decisions, feedback, and recommendations for future reference and accountability.

8. **Follow Up on Feedback:** Follow up on review feedback and recommendations by addressing identified issues and incorporating suggested improvements into the codebase.

## Pitfalls to Avoid

- Being overly critical or dismissive of feedback.
- Focusing solely on coding style and syntax.
- Ignoring documentation and test coverage.
- Rushing through the review process without thorough examination.
