# Code Reviews

## What are Code Reviews?

Code reviews involve examining and evaluating code written by peers to ensure its quality, efficiency, and adherence to established standards. They provide an opportunity for collaboration, knowledge sharing, and early identification of issues in the development process. The goal is to achieve consistent progress and minimize defects in production by adhering to best practices in code reviews process.

## Benefits of Code Reviews
**Code reviews offer numerous benefits to both individualsâ€™ developers and the entire team. By conducting regular code reviews, you can:**
- Improve code quality and readability.
- Identify and address bugs and vulnerabilities early. 
- Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members.
- Ensure overall software development process.

## Best Practices for Code Reviews

### Prior to a Code Review:
1. **Establish Clear Guidelines:** Define clear guidelines and standards for code reviews, including coding conventions, design patterns, and documentation requirements.
2. **Self Review:** Before submitting your code for review, ensure that:
    - Your code is well-documented and follows the agreed upon coding standards.
    - You have performed unit testing where possible, to verify functionality.
    - The changes are concise and focused, ideally not exceeding the agreed upon lines of code per review.

### When Conducting a Code Review:
1. **Conduct Regular Reviews:** Schedule regular code review sessions as part of the development process to ensure prompt and comprehensive review of code changes.

2. **Involve Multiple Reviewers:** Encourage participation from multiple reviewers with varying levels of experience to gain diverse perspectives and insights.

3. **Provide Constructive Feedback:** Offer actionable feedback and suggestions for improvement, focusing on specific issues and areas for enhancement.

4. **Review the Code Not the Coder:** Focus on the code changes and not the individual who wrote them.

5. **Document Review Decisions:** Maintain a record of review decisions, feedback, and recommendations for future reference and accountability.

6. **Use Automated Tools:** Leverage automated code analysis tools to augment manual reviews and identify common issues such as coding errors and security vulnerabilities.

7. **Prioritise High-Impact Changes:** Prioritise code reviews for high-impact changes, such as new features or critical bug fixes, to ensure thorough review and validation.

### After the Code Review:
1. **Follow Up on Feedback:** Follow up on review feedback and recommendations by addressing identified issues and incorporating suggested improvements into the codebase.
2. **Update Code Review:** Update any necessary code and documentation before resubmitting for code review. Repeat process until changes are approved.
3. **Ensure All Tests Pass:** Once changes are approved, ensure all tests are passed before merging the changes.

## Pitfalls to Avoid

- Being overly critical or dismissive of feedback.
- Focusing solely on coding style and syntax.
- Ignoring documentation and test coverage.
- Rushing through the review process without thorough examination.
