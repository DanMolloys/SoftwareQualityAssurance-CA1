# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

## What is Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment?
Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.

Continuous deployment (CD) is a strategy in software development where code changes to an application are released automatically into the production environment.

## Benefits of CI and CD
Both Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment have indvidual benefits that when combined lead to improved efficency in software development in teams.

### Continuous Integration
1. <b>Faster Iteration</b>: Changes can be more confidently and frequently committed, leading to faster development and release cycles.
2. <b>Reduced Risk</b>: Regular integration helps detect and locate issues early, making them less costly and easier to fix.
3. <b>Efficiency</b>: Developers spend less time debugging and more time building new features, which leads to a more efficent team.

### Continuous Deployment
1. <b>Consistentency</b>: The environment setup and deployment process is consistent due to automation, reducing the chances of environment-specific failures.
2. <b>Reliability</b>: Frequent releases make the process predictable and improve the system's stability and reliability.
3. <b>Time-to-Market</b>: Changes can be released to customers quickly, increasing the speed of delivery for new features and reducing the amount of downtime and ticket requests

## Best Practices of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment?

## Things to avoid
- <b>Infrequent Commits</b>, developers should commit their changes frequently to avoid integration problems.
- <b>Lack of Communication</b>, every team member should be instantly informed about the build status after a change.
- <b>Lack of Documentation</b>, documenting the process, changes, and the system status is crucial for maintaining and troubleshooting the CI/CD pipeline.
