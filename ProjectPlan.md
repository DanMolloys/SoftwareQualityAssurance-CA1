## Review and Feedback

All team members must read other team member's work and provide feedback on each other's pull requests. Each pull request must be reviewed by a team member before it can be merged into the develop branch. Team members are also responsible for merging their own pull requests after they have been approved.

## Final Review
Once all the sections have been written, reviewed, and merged into the develop branch, the team will collectively review the entire handbook.

## For Next Time
At the end of the project, each team member should reflet and think what they could have done differently.
