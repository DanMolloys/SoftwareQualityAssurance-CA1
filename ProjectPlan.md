# Project Plan
## Project Plan Brief

 What are the different tasks that you need to do to complete the project, what order do they need to happen in   and who is going to work on each one.

 ## Git Flow
 1. Create and push `develop` branch to repo
 2. Checkout feature branches for each topic from `develop` branch (`git checkout -b [branch name]`
 3. Commit and push changes to relevant feature branch (`git add [file name]`, `git commit -m "[commit message]"`, `git push`)
 4. Open pull request to `develop` branch for review
 5. Address any comments to pull request before merging into `develop` branch
 6. Ensure all local branches are up-to-date with remote (`git pull`)

## Review and Feedback

All team members must read other team member's work and provide feedback on each other's pull requests. Each pull request must be reviewed by a team member before it can be merged into the develop branch. Team members are also responsible for merging their own pull requests after they have been approved.

## Final Review
Once all the sections have been written, reviewed, and merged into the develop branch, the team will collectively review the entire handbook.

## For Next Time
At the end of the project, each team member should reflect and think what they could have done differently.
