# Software Quality Assurance CA1

**Group 9:** Daniel Molloy, Hannah Stapleton, Jeff Horbah

## Scenario

You work for a small, fast moving startup with 20 software engineers. Up to now each engineer on the team has been doing things their own way. Unfortunately this has resulted in very unpredictable progress with projects and a lot of defects making it into production.

Your small team has been asked to research and write a handbook of best practices. Existing and new members of the team will read this to learn what is the "right way" to do things in this company.

The handbook should cover the following topics:

- Task estimation in Scrum

- Code reviews

- And one other topic of your choosing, based on your own research

## Requirements

Your team is made up of three developers. Each of you will contribute new content to the project from your computers and also review the other developers contribution.

Your handbook should have an introduction that explains the purpose as well as the structure of the document. It will have a section for each topic that introduces the topic briefly and then summarizes the most important guidelines in bullet points / diagrams. Note that it's just as important to highlight bad practices to avoid as good practices to follow.

Aim for 500 - 1000 words per topic. Pictures/diagrams are excellent for conveying a lot of information quickly. Each section should also contain links to the reference articles for further reading. 

### Project Structure

* Application code can be found in the [`/app/`](/app/) folder.
* Source files are written in markdown and can be identified by the `.md` file extension.

## Handbook

- [Project Plan](ProjectPlan.md)
