## Introduction to the Engineering Best Practices Handbook

Welcome to our Engineering Best Practices Handbook! As a dynamic and innovative startup, we’ve reached a pivotal moment in our growth. Our team of 20 talented software engineers has brought us this far with their individual expertise and unique approaches.
 However, as we scale, the need for a cohesive and standardized way of working has become evident. The diversity in methods, while valuable, has led to unpredictable project timelines and an increase in production defects.

This handbook is crafted to align our engineering efforts and set a standard for the “right way” to do things within our company. It serves as a guide for both existing team members and newcomers, ensuring that everyone is on the same page and moving in the
 same direction.

In these pages, you’ll find a collection of best practices covering essential topics such as:

Task Estimation in Scrum: Learn how to accurately estimate tasks to ensure sprints are successful and deliverables are met on time.

Code Reviews: Understand the importance of peer reviews in maintaining code quality and how to conduct them effectively.

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): Discover the benefits of integrating and deploying code frequently to catch defects early and reduce time to market.

Our goal is to foster an environment of collaboration, efficiency, and quality. By adhering to these practices, we can enhance our workflow, reduce errors, and continue to innovate at the speed our industry demands. Let’s embark on this journey together, towards
 a more structured and productive future.

## What we Would do Differently
- Add more detail to commit messages and pull requests to make reviewing easier
- Allotting more time to the review process
- Better plan and research git proccesses and git flow
